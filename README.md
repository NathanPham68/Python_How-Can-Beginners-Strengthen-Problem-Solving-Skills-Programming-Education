<img width="1111" height="528" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47221320-425c-4aab-899b-2630e67dd953" />

Welcome to this Python practice project! This repository is designed to help beginners strengthen their problem-solving skills through a series of short, practical exercises. You'll learn to apply Python fundamentals such as data types, functions, loops, string manipulation, and basic data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries) in real-world scenarios.

## üéØ **Project Goals**

By working through these exercises, you'll be able to:

‚úÖ Choose and apply the right data types for real-world problems

‚úÖ Define and use functions, loops, and conditions effectively

‚úÖ Apply computational thinking: breaking down problems step-by-step

‚úÖ Strengthen your confidence in basic coding and logical flow

If you get stuck or have any questions, feel free to reach out!

Happy coding üé∂

## üß† **Problem-Solving Mindset (Step-by-Step Guide)**

Each exercise follows a logical approach that you can use when solving any Python problem:

1. Read & Understand the Problem
‚Üí Identify the goal, keywords, and the expected input/output

2. Clarify Input and Output
‚Üí Know the required data type and format clearly

3. Sketch a Quick Plan
‚Üí Outline your solution idea briefly

4. Link Back to What You've Learned
‚Üí Map your plan to Python knowledge: loops, conditions, etc.

5. Break Down the Problem
‚Üí Think in smaller steps:

    - Looping through data

    - Checking conditions

    - Updating variables or collections

6. Write a Function Skeleton
‚Üí Example: def function_name(params): ...

7. Implement Step-by-Step Logic
‚Üí Code exactly what you planned using loop ‚Üí condition ‚Üí update flow

8. Test with Sample Inputs
‚Üí Compare actual output with the expected one

9. Refactor if Needed
‚Üí Improve readability, fix bugs, or optimize performance

### Exercise 1: Write a function count_vowels(s) that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string 'This Is Just A String That We Use To Practice'

Objetives: Practice Problem Solving, String Manipulating, Loop, Define Function

* Code

```ruby
def count_vowels(given_string):
  vowels = 0

  # loop for given_string
  for i in given_string.lower():
    if i in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
      # update vowels
      vowels += 1
  return vowels

print("Number of vowels:", count_vowels('This Is Just A String That We Use To Practice'))
```

### Exercise 2a: You are managing a small library system and have a list of books. Each book has a title, author, and whether it is currently borrowed. Your task is to organize and analyze the data.

Input: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about a book:

books = [ {"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "borrowed": True}, {"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee", "borrowed": False}, {"title": "The Great Gatsby", "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "borrowed": True}, {"title": "Moby Dick", "author": "Herman Melville", "borrowed": False}, {"title": "War and Peace", "author": "Leo Tolstoy", "borrowed": True}, ]

Write a function that takes a title as input and checks if the book exists in the library. If it does, return 'Borrowed' else return 'Available'. If it doesn't return 'Not exist in the library'

* Code

```ruby
def check_book_status(title, library):
    for book in library:
        # Check if the title matches (case-insensitive)
        if book["title"].lower() == title.lower():
            return "Borrowed" if book["borrowed"] else "Available"
    return "Not exist in the library"

# Sample book list
books = [
    {"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "borrowed": True},
    {"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee", "borrowed": False},
    {"title": "The Great Gatsby", "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "borrowed": True},
    {"title": "Moby Dick", "author": "Herman Melville", "borrowed": False},
    {"title": "War and Peace", "author": "Leo Tolstoy", "borrowed": True},
]

# Test cases
print(check_book_status('1984', books))
print(check_book_status("To Kill a Mockingbird", books))
print(check_book_status("A", books))
```

### Exercise 2b: Count Borrowed and Available Books from books in previous exercise.

* Code

```ruby
def count_books_status(books):
    borrowed_count = 0
    available_count = 0

    for book in books:
        if book["borrowed"]:
            borrowed_count += 1
        else:
            available_count += 1
    return {"borrowed": borrowed_count, "available": available_count}

# Book list (same as before)
books = [
    {"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "borrowed": True},
    {"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee", "borrowed": False},
    {"title": "The Great Gatsby", "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "borrowed": True},
    {"title": "Moby Dick", "author": "Herman Melville", "borrowed": False},
    {"title": "War and Peace", "author": "Leo Tolstoy", "borrowed": True},
]

# Test the function
result = count_books_status(books)
print(result)  # Output: {'borrowed': 3, 'available': 2}
```

### Exercise 5: Anna is submitting a requirement on a platform. Howerver, there are limitations about the number of words and number of characters for the submission. Particularly, the number of world should be under 50 words, and number of character should be under 200 characters. characters don't include special characters as '

Objective: Problem Solving, Loop, Function, List, Set, Dictionary, Define Function.

Please help Anna create a function to do this and check this function with the following submissions!

Submission 1: "I am very excited about the opportunity to work with your company. My skills in data analysis and programming make me confident that I would be a valuable addition to your team. I look forward to the chance to contribute and grow with your company.

Submission 2: "I recently bought this product, and I must say, I'm really impressed. The quality is exceptional, and it works just as advertised. I especially appreciate the ease of use, which makes it perfect for both beginners and experts. I would definitely recommend it to others who are looking for something similar."

* Code

```ruby
import re

def check_submission(text):
    # Remove apostrophes and similar special characters
    cleaned_text = re.sub(r"[‚Äô']", "", text)

    # Count words
    words = cleaned_text.split()
    word_count = len(words)

    # Count characters (excluding special ones)
    char_count = len(cleaned_text)

    # Check limits
    is_valid = word_count < 50 and char_count < 200

    status = "Valid" if is_valid else "Invalid"
    return {
        "status": status,
        "word_count": word_count,
        "character_count": char_count
    }

```ruby
def count_substring(string, sub_string):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string) - len(sub_string) + 1):
